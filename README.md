# Clone-OmeTv-Project
Clone OmeTv Project named FrienBy.Click. This project id for study purose only. This project focuses on how to make an online video call, matching call with other person, basic js polling chat and some bootstrap design. There is no intention to sabotage OmeTv or any negative action to OmeTv. I have recorded full tutorials and how to write it on my YouTube channel (in malay language). Visit https://frienby.click for live project (you can try and register for free!). 

# Project Background
For frontend, I use bootstrap because I think its the simplest choice to start a project (includes many resoureces out there). For WebRTC I use PeerJS api ad Peer Server to simplified the call handlng. For Backend I use PHP, my own PHP Framework (a small and simple one).

# Security
This project is not fully secured as the peerid for each user has been fixed. Supposely the id should changed to make it secure and people cant intercept the call (if hacker knows your peerid). But so far, the basic idea and main module is inside it, you can make it secured on your own. I ll keep posting videos on upgrading this project, so fork me and subscribe me on youtube.
